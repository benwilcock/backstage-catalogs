# My Backstage Catalogs

## Organisations

* The `org-tanzu-tmm.yml` describes the organisational structure that I work in. It's not accurate, just sufficient for demos.

## Systems

* the `system-polyglot-demo-apps.yml` describes the polyglot microservices I wrote using four different languages and frameworks. This links our to their code and documentation. It also links them to the "Tanzu" organisation from the list above.
